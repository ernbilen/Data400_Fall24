Here are some suggestions for questions to ask at your interview. Feel free to adjust the wording where needed:

1. What skillsets or interests led you into your current role?
2. What skillsets do you currently use now? What traits are very vital in your position?
3. What skillsets should we work on, given that we are still in college and there is time to improve?
4. What are your thoughts about generative AI and its future impact?
5. How has Dickinson prepared you for your carreer? (Soft-skills?)
6. What platforms or software do you or your company use?
7. What are your thoughts about managing projects involving data? We are Data Analytics capstone students currently working on our capstone project, so any advice would be appreciated!
