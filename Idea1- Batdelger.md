# Idea 1: Impact of Economic Cycles on Cosmetics Sales 

> Introduction 

In this project, the focus is on examining the relationship between economic cycles—booms and recessions—and consumer behavior in the cosmetics industry. Cosmetics, often seen as a discretionary item, can provide unique insights into how consumers adjust their spending habits based on their economic circumstances. Understanding these patterns can help businesses in the beauty industry strategize more effectively during periods of economic uncertainty.  Other ideas that could be analyzed through this research are how consumers tend to buy more small luxury goods, which is often cosmetics good, during the economic recession rather than splurging on other big luxury items. 

> Objectives 

- To analyze how cosmetic sales fluctuate during recessions and economic booms. 

- To identify whether consumers shift their preferences from premium to budget brands during downturns. 

- To determine the impact of economic confidence on the frequency of purchases. 

- To identify other related consumers behavior 

> Data Sources 

- Macroeconomic Data: GDP growth rates, unemployment rates, and consumer confidence indices from sources like the World Bank or government economic databases. 

- Stock Prices: Historical stock prices and rates of cosmetic companies during different periods.  

- Sales Data: Historical sales data from cosmetic companies or retail outlets during different economic periods. 

- Consumer Surveys: Surveys reflecting consumer sentiment during economic recessions and booms, specifically targeting the beauty industry. 

> Methodology 

- Data Collection: Gather macroeconomic indicators for key periods of boom and recession alongside historical cosmetics sales data. 

- Data Preprocessing: Clean the sales data and align it with the corresponding economic periods. 

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Use visualization techniques to explore trends and correlations between economic health and cosmetic sales. 

- Statistical Modeling: Build regression models to quantify the relationship between macroeconomic variables (e.g., GDP, unemployment) and cosmetic sales. 

- Time-Series Analysis: Conduct time-series forecasting to predict future cosmetic sales based on historical data and economic indicators. 

- Visual analysis: Use visualization software to obtain trends analysis.  

> Expected Outcomes 

- Trend Analysis: Insights into whether consumers tend to spend less or switch to lower-priced products during recessions and more during economic booms. 

- Brand Sensitivity: Identifying whether premium cosmetic brands are more sensitive to economic downturns compared to mass-market brands. 

- Forecasting: Ability to predict future sales based on economic conditions. 

> Conclusion 

This project aims to provide valuable insights into consumer behavior in the cosmetics industry during varying economic conditions. Understanding these dynamics can help businesses adapt their marketing and product strategies to maximize sales during both recessions and booms. Also, it could potentially suggest underlying consumer behavior impacted by economic cycles.
