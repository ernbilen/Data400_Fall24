1)	Research question- try to be as focused and as specific as possible. The Effect book is an invaluable resource here. Take a look at the chapter readings from it on the syllabus.

Does a Video Gameâ€™s sales value reflect the likeability of the game? In other words, do games that generate more sales, also have better reviews than those that do not sell as well. This could also be further investigated by which company published the game, and the different resources provided by these publishers. If the publisher has more revenue, there is larger teams working on the games and more marketing being done, which usually results in higher sales.

2)	Data source, with details about how you will get the data, what variables the dataset has or you will create etc. This can get pretty long, which is fine!

There is a dataset on Kaggle that has a list of 16600 video games with their names, Platform, Year it was released, Genre, Publisher, and sales data. I was able to make an account and download the csv file from there. There are also websites where you are able to data-scrape the reviews, this however may take longer to complete than is allotted for this project. I would also then have to run a text analysis on the reviews, unless they are already given a numerical rating.

3)	What you will do with the data, EDA, model specification.

I will check for duplicates or prequels, for example Fifa 14-16, which may affect the overall sales of the games. I will also check for any outliers or missing data that may impact the outcome of my research. I will use a regression model in order to explore the relationship between the sales and the reviews surrounding the video game.

4)	What are the ethical implications of your project?

This project would be fairly ethical, it would not affect many people directly, but it may open the door to more research on how to make better games, focusing on the types of games we know people enjoy. It does bring up the question though of how do we create better games without also creating a monopoly within the gaming industry? for example if you need a bigger programming team and more marketing, only people with a certain amount of money will be able to achieve it, so how do we make it more accessible to create video games while also creating better games.
