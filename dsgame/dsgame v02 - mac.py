You have two resources that you need to keep track of: Data Analytics (DA) points, and user trust. You begin with 25 DA points and 25 user trust points.
DA points are like moneyüíµ DA points are precious because it helps you buildüî® more, bigger, and better data analysis products. \nUser trust represents your customer baseüòá User trust is precious because
it helps ensure customers want to use your application. You will spend these
resources, or earn more of them, depending on the choices you make in your policy. Try not to let your DA points and user trust fall below 15. If you complete the game with less than 15 points each, you lose the game. If any of these reach to 0, you automatically lose the game!üò¨

In each turn, you will be given choices that will affect your balance of DA points and user trust. When you‚Äôve completed your decisions, the game will draw an event card at random. Event cards represent the many things in design you can't see coming. You'll be presented with new opportunities and challenges that you'll have to make decisions about, and you may gain or lose resources depending on the decisions you've already made. After the card is drawn and its effect is applied, your turn is completed. Keyboard commands for the game are:

  yes - submits a "yes" response
  no  - submits a "no" response

When prompted for an action, you can also enter one of these
commands without using up your turn:

  status - lists the current round #, DA points, trust points
