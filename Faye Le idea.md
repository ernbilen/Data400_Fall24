Research Proposal: Finding the Best Content Category on Social Media (Instagram and YouTube) for Wealth Generation


1) Research Question
The research seeks to answer the following question:
Which content category on social media platforms (Instagram and YouTube) is most effective for generating significant wealth, based on metrics such as follower count, likes, and comments?

This study aims to determine which types of content—such as fashion, beauty, fitness, entertainment, education, or tech—are most likely to lead influencers to substantial financial success. Financial success in this context is proxied by high follower counts, strong engagement rates (likes and comments), and the ability to attract sponsorships or monetization opportunities.

2) Data Source
The datasets to be used for this project are:

Kaggle: Social Media Influencers (June 2022 - Instagram Dataset)
Kaggle: Social Media Influencers (June 2022 - YouTube Dataset)

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramjasmaurya/top-1000-social-media-channels?select=social+media+influencers-instagram+june+2022+-+june+2022.csv

Data Overview: Both datasets cover key influencer metrics on Instagram and YouTube as of June 2022. The datasets include variables such as:

Follower/ Subscriber Count: Total number of followers per influencer.
Engagement Rate: Percentage of followers engaging with posts.
Likes: Number of likes per post.
Comments: Number of comments per post.
Content Category: The type of content (e.g., fashion, fitness, tech).


3) Methodology

Distribution Analysis: Examine the distribution of followers/subscribers, likes, and comments across different content categories.
Correlation Analysis: Assess the correlation between the number of followers/subscribers and engagement metrics such as likes and comments to evaluate how engagement drives follower growth.
Category Breakdown: Analyze the performance of content categories (e.g., beauty, fitness, tech) on both platforms to identify the top-performing content for wealth generation.
Model Specification:

Regression Models: Use linear and multiple regression models to analyze the relationship between content category (independent variable) and the wealth generation metrics (dependent variables: followers, likes, comments, engagement score).
Instagram: Followers = β0 + β1(Likes) + β2(Comments) + β3(Content Category)
YouTube: Subscribers = β0 + β1(Likes) + β2(Comments) + β3(Content Category)
Clustering: Use clustering techniques such as K-means to group content categories by engagement patterns and follower growth. This will help uncover trends in content category success based on platform dynamics.
Outcome: The analysis will provide a ranking of content categories based on their potential to attract large audiences and generate high engagement on Instagram and YouTube. This will highlight which content types provide the highest financial opportunities for influencers.
