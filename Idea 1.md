### Research Question:

How does the sentiment expressed in online customer reviews influence the click-through rate (CTR) of product advertisements on Amazon?

### Data Source:
Amazon Product Advertising API and Amazon Customer Reviews Dataset (on Kaggle)

**Data Retrieval**:
* Amazon Customer Reviews (on Kaggle): This dataset includes:
    * Review Text: The actual customer review text (raw text).
    * Review Rating: Star rating from 1 to 5.
    * Product ID: Unique identifier for each product.
    * Review Date: Date when the review was posted.
    * Helpful Votes: Number of users who found the review helpful.
* Online Advertising CTR Dataset (Retrieved using the Amazon Product Advertising API): This dataset includes:
    * Ad Impressions: Number of times the ad was shown.
    * Clicks: Number of times the ad was clicked.
    * CTR: Click-through rate, calculated as the ratio of clicks to impressions.
    * Product ID: To connect ad data with review sentiment.

### Data Analysis and Modeling:

* Sentiment Analysis: The reviews will be classified into three sentiment categories: positive, neutral, and negative. These sentiment categories will be the independent variable for the model.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
* Descriptive statistics of CTR, review ratings, and other variables.
* Distributions of variables (review ratings), frequency of words used in the reviews, and visualizations to explore relationships between variables.
* Correlation analysis to identify potential relationships between variables.

**Model Specification**:
* Logistic Regression: This model will be used to predict the likelihood of a product ad receiving clicks based on the sentiment of customer reviews.


### Implications for Stakeholders:

* Advertisers: By understanding how positive or negative sentiment in reviews affects CTR, advertisers can optimize their campaigns by focusing on products with better customer sentiment or tailoring their ads based on review feedback.
* E-commerce Platforms: Platforms like Amazon or other e-commerce sites can use sentiment data to refine their recommendation systems and ad placements, increasing relevance and improving user experience.
* Consumers: A more personalized advertising experience, driven by customer feedback, can lead to better product recommendations and ads that reflect consumer preferences.

### Ethical, Legal, and Societal Implications:
* Privacy: The data used for analysis will be aggregated and anonymized, ensuring no personally identifiable information (PII) is exposed.
* Avoiding Bias: Care will be taken to avoid biases in the models, particularly around certain types of products or demographics that may skew sentiment analysis results.
* Transparency: In a real world application, it would be important to maintain transparency with consumers about how their reviews are being used to influence ad placement, fostering trust between the platform and users.
