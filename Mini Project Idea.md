Mini-Project Idea
1)	Research question- try to be as focused and as specific as possible. The Effect book is an invaluable resource here. Take a look at the chapter readings from it on the syllabus.

At what age are dancers most vulnerable to injury? When should injury prevention education begin for dancers?
Many dancers will begin classes at a very early age, oftentimes starting at 2-3 years old, and will continue dancing throughout their lives in some way. Research shows that dancers will average one injury per year, but when are the most intense and long-lasting injuries occurring? Since smaller injuries are more normalized for dancers, many times they will not seek medical attention and will attempt to heal themselves at home. I think it’s very important to educate young dancers on injury prevention and recovery, but when is the time to begin this education? I had no form of this education until college and by then I had already experienced multiple injuries, many I’m sure will be long lasting as they were not treated properly, so this is a very important topic to me personally as well as many dance companies, because if many dancers are injured in their young lives they may not be able to perform to the best of their abilities as they continue on in their career, which is not great for companies trying to hire long-term dancers. This education will not only help companies find long term dancers but will allow dancers who want to pursue this type of career a better chance at achieving that goal, many dancers will experience career ending injuries at a very young age, so having this type of education will allow them to continue exploring their passion as a dancer in a safer way. This also connects directly to Dickinson as we offer a class on anatomy and injury prevention, as well as have a seminar on injury prevention within the Dance Theater Group, but we do not have access to the same resources as the Athletics Department. This could also help bring change to the local dance studios in the Carlisle area if Dickinson can find a way to teach them about injury prevention as well, especially if my findings do find a younger age to be the most vulnerable to more intense dance-related injuries.

2)	Data source, with details about how you will get the data, what variables the dataset has or you will create etc. This can get pretty long, which is fine!

I will be using Data from the NEISS database, it is a free database from participating Emergency Rooms around the United States. It compiles data about each patient, what they were seen for, what their diagnosis was, etc. I was able to submit a query on the website to get the information I wanted from the database: dance related injuries on people ages 3-40 years old, all genders, all races, what their diagnosis was, and what they originally came in for from the past 10 years, so 2014-2024. After submitting this query the NEISS gave me an excel sheet that I was able to download and will further clean up from there. The data has been broken down by years, so once I have cleaned up each individual year I will put them together for my analysis. 

3)	What you will do with the data, EDA, model specification.

There is a large amount of data available to me so I may not include all 10 years, I also plan to narrow down the data to those who are active dancers, whether it is just classes, or a professional career, so that the people who were just dancing with friends and tripped are not included. Once I have cleaned up the data I plan to do some EDA to find any outliers that may affect my results, find if there is anything missing from the columns I am hoping to use, and look at the shape of the age data as well to better decide on a model, or if I need to do any further cleaning/data manipulation. I will then sort the data by age and figure out the most frequent age that comes up. Once I have found that I also plan to find the most intense injuries/diagnoses and find which age they are mostly occurring at, the injury type data has already been converted into a numerical format so this will be helpful in this process. For the ages I can use a bar plot to better visualize the ages that are present, and I will use a regression model for the intensity of the injury vs. the age of the patient to better determine when the best time for dancers’ injury prevention education is to begin.
