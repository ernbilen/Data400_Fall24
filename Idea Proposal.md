# **Idea Proposal** 
## Title: Sleep, smoke, and health
--- Sleep has been a major part of people’s life,but how does a person’s sleep quality affect by tobacco, or e-cigarette. Do people smokes before sleeping, or after sleep? Does it help with ease of mind? How bad was people's sleep quality when they have smoking habit. We can also use the result of this project to help create a sleep haibt, or a healthy habit in general for people who are in the young adolescent age, to help with cognitive and motor function skills.
The based for assuming sleep quality based on questionnaire score, and other factors in the dataset that indicates health quality.

1. Dataset:
CDC, data.gov, sleep research project for sleep pattern, as well as questionnaire for smoking habit. 

2. Model:
The best chance would be linear model, where we could compare the groups of people who smokes and people who does not smokes sleep quality, and health quality. 

3. Implication: 
Help with understanding human behavior, especially with smoking, something that is addictive, and hard to quit. The project would try its best to raise awareness on tobacco use and unhealthy habits among people, especially young adults. 
This also helps with people who are serious about their sleeping habit, and healthy lifestyle in general, and it could help parents and professional caregivers think of a better plan for their family members/patients.
