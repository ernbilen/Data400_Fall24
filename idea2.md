**<span style="font-size:2em;">Idea #2</span>**


**<span style="font-size:1.5em;">1) Research Question</span>**

I would like to research how to predict the winner of a basketball game. What factors play bigger parts in determining a win? Number of assists, number of steals, 3 point percentage, field goal percentage, free throws, time in possession, and turnovers are some of the statistics I'd like to look at. This analysis could have an impact on winning more games which is always the goal of sports. I would also like to try predicting stats like which players will have a double-double in a game.

2) Data source</span>**

*<span style="font-size:1.1em;">
a) With details about how you will get the data</span>*

*<span style="font-size:1.1em;">
b) What variables the dataset has or you will create</span>*

*<span style="font-size:1.1em;">
c) This can get pretty long, which is fine!</span>*

Dickinson mens basketball has given me access to their three databases which include data about their team going back to 2015 and all NCAA mens basketball teams. They have every statistic I mentioned above and many many more.  

**<span style="font-size:1.5em;">3) What you will do with the data, EDA, model specification.</span>**

I want to create some visualizations and maybe shot heat maps before creating a model - likely a mixed effects regression model to determine points scored and also maybe a mixed effects logistical model determining whether Dickinson will win the game or not. 

**<span style="font-size:1.5em;">4) What are some ethical considerations for this topic?</span>**

I don't think there are many ethical considerations as the data is only about basketball which is not really a sensitive topic. There is no personal information about players beyond height, weight, year and name (name can be easily excluded from results if desired). I will need to talk to the basketball coaches about where this data can go but from our first meeting they seemed very open with me using it in a class for a project.
