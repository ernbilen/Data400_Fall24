**<span style="font-size:2em;">Idea #3</span>**


**<span style="font-size:1.5em;">1) Research Question</span>**

I have read about Monte Carlo simulations and I would like to try to do some with basketball win percentage. What are the odds Dickinson Mens Basketball wins a game against a certain team based on a set of factors? 


**<span style="font-size:1.5em;">
2) Data source</span>**

*<span style="font-size:1.1em;">
a) With details about how you will get the data</span>*

*<span style="font-size:1.1em;">
b) What variables the dataset has or you will create</span>*

*<span style="font-size:1.1em;">
c) This can get pretty long, which is fine!</span>*

Dickinson mens basketball has given me access to their three databases which include data about their team going back to 2015 and all NCAA mens basketball teams. They have statistics as a team and as individual players for all the basic statistics like free throw %, field goal %, 3 point %, steals, assists, time with possession and turnovers. They also have many more statistics for team and individual. 

**<span style="font-size:1.5em;">3) What you will do with the data, EDA, model specification.</span>**

I would run Monte Carlo simulations after creating data visualizations of the variables I chose to use in the simulations. I would run simulations of past games to see what the accuracy percentage of the predictor is before using it to predict upcoming games. 


**<span style="font-size:1.5em;">4) What are some ethical considerations for this topic?</span>**

I don't think there are many ethical considerations as the data is only about basketball which is not really a sensitive topic. There is no personal information about players beyond height, weight, year and name (name can be easily excluded from results if desired). I will need to talk to the basketball coaches about where this data can go but from our first meeting they seemed very open with me using it in a class for a project.
