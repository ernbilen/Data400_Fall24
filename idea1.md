**<span style="font-size:2em;">Idea #1</span>**


**<span style="font-size:1.5em;">1) Research Question</span>**

How do the number/type of roads/factories/oil wells in an area impact the number of air quality and asthma/lung health issues? I want to explore if more factories in an area coincides with more lung health issues and the same with more roads and oil wells in the area. I also want to see if an increase in factories results in worse air quality, as well as the same process with roads and oil wells. I am thinking of confining this research to Pennsylvania as it is easier to find county by county data if you focus on one state and I feel that state by state data is too broad for my idea.

2) Data source</span>**

*<span style="font-size:1.1em;">
a) With details about how you will get the data</span>*

*<span style="font-size:1.1em;">
b) What variables the dataset has or you will create</span>*

*<span style="font-size:1.1em;">
c) This can get pretty long, which is fine!</span>*

I plan to use data about the road systems such as the miles of road in each state, broken down by rural/urban, interstate/not. This data comes from the US Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration and is state by state. I found detailed road information for PA cities. 

I found data from the US Census regarding the types and number of each type of business in every county of each US state. This data is available from 2002 to 2022. 

I have found data through the Center for Disease Control that supplies the number and percentage of people with asthma in each state from 1999 to 2020. I have also found data from Pennsylvania Commonwealth detailing the percentage of students who have asthma by county.

I found data showing how many oil and gas wells have been drilled in each county of Pennsylvania and it can be displayed by whatever dates you want to search for. This data is from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.

**<span style="font-size:1.5em;">3) What you will do with the data, EDA, model specification.</span>**

I want to create heat maps with the amount of roads per county, oil wells and factories. I would also break this down by population and land size as well. I would repeat the same process with number of people with lung health issues. I would try to create a model that predicted the number/percentage of people with lung issues/asthma based on roads, factories, air quality and oil/gas wells.
