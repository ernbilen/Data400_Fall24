1) Research Question

What content strategies (e.g., frequency, type of content) are more effective for micro- versus macro-influencers?
How does the content frequency impact the engagement rate of micro- vs. macro-influencers?

Micro-Influencers: 1,000 - 100,000 followers
Macro-Influencers: 100,000+ followers

3) Methodology

a) Data Cleaning and Classification

Clean the dataset by removing any duplicate entries or incomplete data (e.g., missing values for #Followers, #Posts).
Classify influencers into two groups:
Micro-influencers: Less than 100,000 followers.
Macro-influencers: More than 100,000 followers.
b) Content Strategy Analysis

Post Frequency: For each influencer, calculate their post frequency by dividing the total number of posts by the number of months or years the account has been active (if account creation date is available or can be estimated).
Perform a comparison of post frequency between micro- and macro-influencers.
â€‹

c) Statistical Analysis

T-tests: Compare the average post frequency between micro- and macro-influencers to identify any significant differences.
Correlation analysis: Analyze the correlation between post frequency and engagement rate for both micro- and macro-influencers.

d) Visualization and Interpretation

Use visualizations like bar charts, scatter plots, and histograms to showcase the distribution of post frequency, engagement rates, and how they differ between the two influencer categories.
Interpret the results to determine which strategies (e.g., frequent posting, specific content types) lead to higher engagement for micro-influencers compared to macro-influencers.
