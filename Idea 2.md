1)	Research question- try to be as focused and as specific as possible. The Effect book is an invaluable resource here. Take a look at the chapter readings from it on the syllabus.

Does the increase of the minimum wage impact the amount of hours people are working in the retail sector? As more employees fight to raise the minimum wage, what may be the impact on the hours they are given? Many employees today are turning away from the average 9-5 and looking for more flexible hours, but can we have both higher wages and these types of flexibility, while also paying the bills?

2)	Data source, with details about how you will get the data, what variables the dataset has or you will create etc. This can get pretty long, which is fine!

The Bureau of Labor Statistics has many data sets and visualizations available for people to use, I would get my data from here. It will be a fairly simple data set, exploring the average hours worked per week by those employees in the retail sector. The national minimum wage is easily trackable, but many companies are opting to give their employees higher minimum wages, so we can also use the Bureau of Labor Statistics information on that. The data can be broken down by year, month, and week. 

3)	What you will do with the data, EDA, model specification.

In terms of EDA I will look for any missing values or outliers that may be impacting the outcome, as well as finding a minimum and maximum value, as this may give some insight into seasonality, or help to visualize the trends that have arisen in the past years. 
I will use a time series model in order to predict what the number of hours worked per week, on average will be as the minimum wages paid increases, and therefore see if there will be any further changes.

4)	What are the ethical implications of your project?

The ethical implications of my project are more on the positive side, it can help employees look at the amount that they are being paid currently and their own amount of weekly hours on average, and use it to negotiate a better wage, or a better work schedule. Another implication of my project is that it could show a decrease in hours as the wage increases, this could force employees to find second or third jobs, and eventually turn towards burnout as so many are. But is it really fair to keep some employees at only $7.25 per hour? It is a very tough question to answer, but I hope this research could bring us towards a better solution for everyone.
